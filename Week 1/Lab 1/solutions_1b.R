# Exercise (page 5)
# What do you "see" in the plot?

# The suggested website
#   https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/mpg.html
# gives a description of each variable.
# In the plot we have displ (x-axis), hwy (y-axis),
# class (colour), and cyl (size of symbol)

# displ -- engine displacement/size (litres)
# hwy -- highway miles per gallon (fuel efficiency)
# class -- type of car
# cyl -- number of cylinders

# Interpreting the plot, what stands out:
#   * cars with poor fuel efficiency (hwy) have large
#     engines (displ) with many cylinders (cyl)
#   * cars with good fuel efficiency have small engines
#   * classes of car generally cluster together
#     in terms of fuel efficiency and engine size

# -- the end --
